# LastDash  
## Purpose
LastDash is a bus-tracking app that allows users to enter their current address and receive information about nearby bus routes and stops in the Lower Mainland. Users also have the ability to add specific routes and their bus stop to a "Favourite Stops" page. All previously searched addresses and viewed bus stops can be accessed via the "Recent Queries" Page. 

*Technologies*: React, Firebase Cloud Firestore, Chakra UI

## What I learned
- Using React with Firebase Cloud Firestore
- Using React with the Chakra UI Component Library 
- React Router Library for static & dynamic routing 
- Integrating API calls using React Hooks (useEffect, useState) (Position Stack API and Translink API)
- Using the Automate on Scroll (AOS) library
